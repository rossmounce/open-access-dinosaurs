open-access-dinosaurs
=====================

Open Access (CC BY or CC0) academic content pertaining to dinosaurs (Dinosauria)

All articles / links to articles MUST be CC BY or CC0. 'free access' articles cannot be included.

So far I have links to 507 CC BY articles.

Admittedly, many of them e.g. the PLOS ONE and BMC articles are not wholly about dinosaurs and instead may only briefly mention or cite dinosaur literature.
